# Next math organ to build

Goal: Get one visible math organ working end-to-end.

1. Confirm cockpit renders in browser (no white screen).
2. Build a "Matrix Playground" organ:
   - Input: 2x2 matrix (form)
   - Backend: NumPy eigenvalues
   - Output: eigenvalues + eigenvectors rendered in JSX

Nice-to-have:
- Add a second organ: "Binary NAND Playground" with a truth table.
